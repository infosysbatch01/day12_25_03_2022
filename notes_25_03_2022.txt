A system table called dual . This table can be used to see the usage of a function or of an expression.

SELECT 2+2 FROM dual

SELECT upper(substr('Welcome',4,3)) FROM dual; -- com
  
    substr(string,startindex)
    substr(string,startindex,length)

Q Display the doj and doj month from the employee table.
  SELECT doj,to_char(doj,'MONTH') from employee;
  SELECT doj,to_char(doj,'Month') from employee;
  SELECT doj,to_char(doj,'month') FROM employee;


Q.  Display the employee details whose date of birth is in the month JUNE.

   SELECT *  FROM employee 
   WHERE to_char(doj,'Month')='June';

   SELECT *  FROM employee 
   WHERE to_char(doj,'month')='june';

SELECT *  FROM employee 
   WHERE to_char(doj,'MONTH')='JUNE';


  SELECT * from employee where to_char(doj,'yyyy')=2020

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Display the sum of salary in the employee table.
A.  SELECT sum(salary) FROM employee;

Q Display the sum of salary where the dept is ETA.
A SELECT sum(salary) FROM employee WHERE dept='eta';
-- It is displaying as null because we have the dept as ETA and not eta. Records are case sensitive.

 SELECT sum(salary) FROM employee WHERE dept='ETA';
 SELECT sum(salary) FROM employee WHERE dept='ICP';


Q Display the sum of salary for the department ETA and ICP.
SELECT sum(salary) FROM employee WHERE dept IN ('ICP','ETA');


SELECT sum(salary) FROM employee WHERE dept='ICP' AND dept='ETA';

Q Display the sum of salary departmentwise.

 SELECT sum(salary)
 FROM employee
 GROUP BY dept;


SELECT dept,sum(salary)
 FROM employee
 GROUP BY dept;
[ Whenever we use group by clause , we work more on aggregate functions ]

Q Diplay the count of employees in each department.

 SELECT dept,count(id)
 FROM employee
 GROUP BY dept;

Q Display depatmentwise maximum salary.

 SELECT dept,max(salary)
 FROM employee
 GROUP BY dept;


Group By converts the entire rows in a group into a single row in result. You cannot fetch details from individual rows in a category. Let us try to fetch count and names of employees in each department.

SELECT Dept, ENAME, Count(ID) 
FROM Employee 
GROUP BY Dept;
[ORA-00979: not a GROUP BY expression]

If we want that the above command executes we have to include ename also
in the group by clause.

SELECT Dept, ENAME, Count(ID) 
FROM Employee 
GROUP BY Dept,ename;
[ Non aggregate column like dept and ename if are present in the
select statement, then they should be used in the group by clause.
If we are not including all the columns which are present with select,
The sql statement will show error during the execution]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If we need to give some condition after grouping , we need to use having clause
alongwith group by.

Display department wise count of employee where the count of employees are more than 2.

SELECT dept,count(id)
FROM employee
GROUP BY dept
HAVING count(id)>2;
[ With having we use aggregate functions to give condition ]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Do’s for Group by and Having clauses:

GROUP BY clause should contain all non-aggregate columns that are present in SELECT clause
SELECT designation,dept,count(id)
FROM employee
GROUP BY designation;
[ The above SQL statement is incorrect because in the select statement we have dept but in 
  group by we are not using dept]


SELECT designation,dept,count(id)
FROM employee
GROUP BY designation,dept;
[ The above statement is correct as in the select statement we have designation and dept and 
  so in the group by clause]


GROUP BY clause should be mandatory when there is a list of aggregate and non-aggregate columns in SELECT statement

SELECT designation,count(id)
FROM employee
[ The above SQL is incorrect , as we have not used the group by clause]

SELECT designation,count(id)
FROM employee
GROUP BY designation
[ The above SQL statement is correct]

Whenever nested aggregate columns appear in the SELECT clause, GROUP BY clause should be mandatorily used

SELECT max(count(id))
FROM employee
[ The above SQL is incorrect]

SELECT desig,count(id)
FROM employee
GROUP BY designation

  Mgr      3
  AsstMgr  6
  Clerk    10

SELECT count(id)
FROM employee
GROUP BY designation
  3
  6
  10


SELECT max(count(id))
FROM employee
group by designation;

   10
 
[ The above SQL is correct. The above SQL statement will return the max number of employees for a 
particular designation]




HAVING cannot be written without the GROUP BY clause in the query


SELECT designation,count(id)
FROM employee
having count(id)>=2
[ The above SQL is incorrect as we dont have group by clause]

SELECT designation,count(id)
FROM employee
group by designation
having count(id)>=2
[ The above SQL statement is correct]

Aggregate column condition(s) should always be written along with the HAVING clause and not with the WHERE clause


SELECT designation,count(id)
FROM employee
WHERE count(id)>=2
group by designation
[ The above statement is incorrect as we are using where and aggregate function]


SELECT designation,count(id)
FROM employee
group by designation
HAVING count(id)>=2
[ The above statement is correct]

Don’ts for Group by and Having clauses:

Columns from the list of the SELECT clause should not be skipped in the GROUP BY clause. However, you can add an extra non-aggregate column which is not present in the SELECT to the GROUP BY clause


SELECT count(id)
FROM employee
GROUP BY dept;
[ The above sql is possible where in the select we are not mentioning any non aggregate column 
  but we are mention it in the group by clause but reverse is not possible which means columns
are mentioned along with select but is not available in the group by clause.]

SELECT dept,desig,count(id)
FROM employee
GROUP BY dept;
[ The above statement is incorrect as we missed mentioning desig in the group by clause.]



GROUP BY clause should not contain any aggregate columns

SELECT designation,count(id)
FROM employee
group by id
[ The above SQL is incorrect]

Aliased name given for the column should not be used in GROUP BY clause

SELECT designation desig,count(id)
FROM employee
group by desig
[ We cannot use the alias name in the group by clause]

HAVING clause should not contain non-aggregate columns which are not present in the GROUP BY clause



SELECT designation,count(id)
FROM employee
group by designation
HAVING dept='ICP'


If the query does not adhere to these points, either it gives syntax error or it may result in a wrong output.
